      <section class="section" id="about">
        <p>I found myself behind a bar when I decided to give up studying in the Academy of Music.
        Then a temporary job became my career. Within 15 years I changed many projects and held different
        positions. As an employee I used to be a part of a team as well as one who led a team.
        Since I didn't have any specific education I had to know how to study.
        Finally I started working as an executive manager of a small boutique hotel in Costa Rica
        where I decided that it should be my last work in the sphere of Hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>There are a lot to learn and to do before I become an experienced developer.
        But also there are some tools that I already have. Those tools one can hardly learn in online courses:
        social intelligence that helps to win trust with colleagues or subordinates,
        self-confidence that makes you able to ask for help when you need it, the ability to ask the right
        questions and to find the right answers. Besides, to be an efficient employee it's necessary
        to know yourself well: your strengths and weaknesses, how to learn new tools, how to use your time.
        I believe that all this will help me to become a proficient Front-end developer.
